# MonolithDKP EasyBid

Independent bidding frame to use with MonolithDKP addon

## Features

- `/ebid` - shows the frame during bidding phase 

- You can easily adjust your bid amount by **several inputs - buttons, slider, text field**

- You can see the whole **history** of item bidding with the display of each player's maximum DKP

- You can **disable auto-popup for specific item types** (e.g.: Leather armor or Two-handed swords) in settings (Interface options -> Addons -> MonDKP EasyBid)

- Configurable minimal bid step

- Provides **link** to current bidding item

 

*This is standalone plugin that hooks on MonolithDKP events, therefore you may want to disable auto-popup for original MonolithDKP frame. If you accidentaly close this frame during bidding, you may open it again with `/ebid`. The original "Bid" button besides the timer opens the original MonolithDKP window.*
